            <h1 class="lawngreen_font">Why Do We Need A Website Just To Find Out The Bus Route Or Timing When I Can Ask The Bus Manager?</h1>
            <h2>A. To Answer That Let's Assume Some Scenarious:</h2>
            <h3>Before The Website Launch</h3>
            <h3>Scenario 1:</h3>
            <p>Junior Student/Faculty: "I'm New To This Institute And Don't Know The Bus Timings For Different Routes. I Wish They Had A Website Just For That"</p>
            <h3>Scenario 2:</h3>
            <p>Senior Student: "Oh Man I Lost My Bus And Don't Know If Any Other Bus Is Gonna Arrive Nearby. Mr. Bus Manager Isn't Picking Up My Phone. I Really Need To Catch Another Bus Cause I Love My College xD"</p>
            <h3>Scenario 3:</h3>
            <p>Bus Manager: "Great! It's Almost Leave Time For Students. Everyone Is Gonna Ask Me About Which Bus Is Going To Which Stop. I Wish I Had A Megaphone To Announce That!</p>
            <h3>After The Website Launch</h3>
            <h3>Scenario 1:</h3>
            <p>Junior Student/Faculty: "I'm Still New To This Institute But Now I Can See Details About Every Bus In This Institute Anytime"</p>
            <h3>Scenario 2:</h3>
            <p>Senior Student: "Oh Man I Lost My Bus Again!, But Luckily BRM Saved Me From Losing Today's Attendance</p>
            <h3>Scenario 3:</h3>
            <p>Bus Manager: "Great! Students Are Leaving And Not A Single Student Bothered Me Today. Looks Like I'm Gonna Retire Soon. I Must Destroy BRM!"</p>
            <h2>So What Do We Learn From These Scenarios?</h2>
            <p>IF You Want Easy Access To Bus Details For EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, Use BRM</p>
            <p>ELSE Keep Losing Attendance/Salary For Petty Reasons</p>
